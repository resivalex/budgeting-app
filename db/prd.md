# Feature: Database (CouchDB)

## Overview

A containerized CouchDB database service that provides the backend data storage and synchronization foundation for the offline-first budgeting application with automatic CORS configuration, persistent data storage, and multi-environment deployment support.

## Functionality

### Core Database Services

- **CouchDB Database Engine**: Robust document-based NoSQL database optimized for distributed applications and offline synchronization
- **Automatic Database Initialization**: Seamless database setup with proper user authentication and initial configuration
- **Persistent Data Storage**: Reliable data persistence with Docker volume mounting for data safety and backup capabilities
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Flexible deployment configurations for development, staging, and production environments

### Synchronization & Replication

- **Built-in Replication**: Native CouchDB replication capabilities for real-time bidirectional data synchronization
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic conflict detection and resolution for concurrent data modifications
- **Change Feed Support**: Real-time change notifications for immediate UI updates and data consistency
- **Offline Synchronization**: Robust offline-first architecture supporting extended periods without connectivity

### Security & Access Control

- **Authentication Management**: Secure user authentication with configurable admin credentials
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained database access permissions and user management
- **Secure Network Communication**: HTTPS support and secure inter-service communication
- **Environment-Based Configuration**: Secure credential management through environment variables

### CORS Configuration

- **Automatic CORS Setup**: Custom initialization script that configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for web application access
- **Configurable CORS Policies**: Flexible CORS settings through environment variables for different deployment scenarios
- **Development-Friendly**: Pre-configured CORS settings optimized for local development and testing
- **Production Security**: Restrictive CORS policies for production deployments with specific origin allowlists

### Container & Deployment

- **Docker Containerization**: Complete containerized deployment with official CouchDB Docker image
- **Docker Compose Integration**: Multi-environment Docker Compose configurations for easy deployment and scaling
- **Custom Initialization**: Enhanced startup script that combines CouchDB initialization with application-specific configuration
- **Port Management**: Flexible port configuration for development exposure and production security
- **Volume Management**: Persistent data volumes with proper backup and recovery capabilities

### Monitoring & Maintenance

- **Health Checks**: Built-in health monitoring and API availability verification
- **Log Management**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and operational monitoring
- **Backup Support**: Data persistence strategy supporting regular backups and disaster recovery
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized CouchDB configuration for the budgeting application's data patterns

## Technical Notes

### Architecture & Deployment

- **CouchDB Official Image**: Uses the official CouchDB Docker image for reliability and security updates
- **Custom Entrypoint Script**: Enhanced startup process with automatic CORS configuration and application-specific setup
- **Multi-Stage Configuration**: Hierarchical Docker Compose setup with base, development, and production configurations
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: Comprehensive configuration management through .env files for different deployment environments

### Data Management

- **Document-Based Storage**: Optimized for the application's transaction and budget document structures
- **JSON Document Model**: Native JSON support for seamless integration with the React TypeScript frontend
- **Index Optimization**: Database indexes optimized for common query patterns (account balances, date ranges, categories)
- **Data Validation**: Schema validation for transaction documents and budget configurations

### Network & Security

- **CORS Automation**: Custom script automatically configures CORS settings based on environment variables
- **Network Isolation**: Production configuration with isolated networks for enhanced security
- **Port Security**: Development mode exposes ports for debugging while production mode keeps them internal
- **Credential Management**: Secure handling of database credentials through environment variables and Docker secrets

### Integration & Synchronization

- **PouchDB Compatibility**: Optimized for seamless integration with PouchDB clients in the web frontend
- **Real-time Updates**: Change feed integration for immediate data synchronization and UI updates
- **Bulk Operations**: Optimized for bulk transaction imports and batch processing operations
- **Conflict Handling**: Sophisticated conflict resolution strategies for concurrent data modifications

### Operational Excellence

- **Container Lifecycle**: Proper container startup, shutdown, and restart handling
- **Process Management**: Background process management with proper signal handling and graceful shutdowns
- **Resource Optimization**: Memory and CPU optimization for efficient container resource utilization
- **Scalability Preparation**: Architecture designed to support horizontal scaling and clustering when needed
